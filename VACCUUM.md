## Background
For our final DSGN 1 project, we applied Norman’s principles of discoverability, feedback, and affordances to a common household appliance. We chose the vacuum because it’s ubiquitous in student housing yet often bulky, noisy, and fiddly to maintain. Over two weeks, we surveyed 15 students in their living spaces to uncover real pain points.

## Problem
How might we design a cordless vacuum for students that feels lightweight, is easy to empty, and stays quiet enough to use in shared spaces?

## Research
### Overview & Goals
To understand where vacuums fail students in small living spaces, we combined quantitative scoring with in‑situ observation and user interviews. Our goals were to:

1. Map performance (suction, noise, durability, portability) across 15 candidate models.
2. Identify pain points in real‑world use.
3. Uncover latent needs around emptying, controls, and maneuverability.

### Quantitative Evaluation
We scored each vacuum on two pairs of axes, then plotted them to spot trade‑offs and outliers.

#### Suction vs Noise

![Two axis, one for noise (i.e. when the vacuum is on) and the other for suction (i.e. how strongly it pulls up debris)](/public/vacuum/suction_noise.png)

**Figure 1:** Most vacuums were considered very noisy, especially if they had a more powerful suction.

#### Durability vs Portability

**Figure 2:** The more portable vacuums suffer from lower durability.
